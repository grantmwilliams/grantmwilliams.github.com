{"name":"Grantmwilliams.GitHub.com","tagline":"","body":"### About Me\r\n![Picture of me!](http://i.imgur.com/c8YsOQ0.jpg) My name is Grant Williams. I am currently a Junior at Oklahoma State University where I am studying Physics and pure Mathematics. My current research interests all revolve around computational physics or modeling, and I am particularly interested in Quantum Information, Condensed Matter, Biophysics, Astrophysics, and other computational physics areas.\r\n\r\nMy current research area revolves around the use of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning techniques to decrease computation time of complex physical systems. I'm currently finishing up a paper where we looked at using a modified genetic algorithm to place wind turbines on a farm efficiently. Along with the first paper I'm finishing a second paper where we compared the efficiency of a newly developed parallel genetic algorithm against similar algorithms in the optimization field.\r\n\r\nAfter my undergraduate studies I hope to pursue a Ph.D in some computational physics area.\r\n\r\n### Contact Me\r\nThe easiest way to get in contact with me is through my email, and please feel connect with me on Linkedin, or follow my Github account!\r\n* Email: gwilli@ostatemail.okstate.edu\r\n* [Linkedin Profile](www.linkedin.com/in/grantmwilliams/en)\r\n* [Github Account](https://github.com/grantmwilliams)\r\n","google":"UA-61325402-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
